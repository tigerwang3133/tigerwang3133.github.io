I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), with a background as a Schreyer Honors Scholar majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). I am currently a member of [SCOPE lab](https://scopelab.rice.edu/), advised by [Prof. Shengxi Huang](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/shengxi-huang) and work closely with [Prof. Yuxuan 'Cosmi' Lin](https://engineering.tamu.edu/materials/profiles/lin-yuxuan-cosmi.html). My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), computational science, and experimental technology, focusing on developing machine learning (ML) methodologies to advance biomedical sciences, materials research, and molecular sensing. My work has contributed to AI-driven innovations in disease diagnosis, biomarker discovery, virus identification, cancer research, and next-generation material characterization. My vision is to leverage ML to enhance scientific instruments, enable automated experiments, and accelerate high-accuracy simulations in biomedical and material sciences. I explore cross-disciplinary applications in food safety, agricultural monitoring, and environmental science to expand ML’s impact across diverse domains and translate these advancements into real-world solutions. My goal is to unlock ML’s transformative potential in scientific discovery, ultimately fostering breakthroughs that improve human health and well-being.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am a co-founder of [iDeal technology LLC](https://www.idealtechnology.org/home/) and developed a mobile app on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uni.UNI6849AE0) and [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ideal%E7%88%B1%E5%85%9C/id1511598159) helping community rentals and trading.  These experiences have honed my skills in entrepreneurship and leadership, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical solutions.
