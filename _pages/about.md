I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), with a background as a Schreyer Honors Scholar majoring in computer science and mathematics from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). I am currently in [SCOPE lab](https://scopelab.rice.edu/), advised by [Prof. Shengxi Huang](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/shengxi-huang) and also work closely with [Prof. Yuxuan 'Cosmi' Lin](https://engineering.tamu.edu/materials/profiles/lin-yuxuan-cosmi.html). My research interests lie in machine learning, leveraging machine learning techniques to address complex bio and material sensing challenges, and I am excited about the potential impact of my research on improving the diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimerâ€™s disease and cancers. 

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am a co-founder of [iDeal technology LLC](https://www.idealtechnology.org/home/) and developed a mobile app on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uni.UNI6849AE0) and [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ideal%E7%88%B1%E5%85%9C/id1511598159) helping community rentaling and trading.  These experiences have honed my skills in entrepreneurship and leadership, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical solutions.
