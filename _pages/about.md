I am a fifth year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), with a background as a Schreyer Honors Scholar majoring in computer science and mathematics from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). I am currently in [SCOPE lab](https://scopelab.rice.edu/), advised by [Prof. Shengxi Huang](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/shengxi-huang) and also work closely with [Prof. Yuxuan 'Cosmi' Lin](https://engineering.tamu.edu/materials/profiles/lin-yuxuan-cosmi.html). My research leverages machine learning (ML) to advance material characterization and biosensing. My vision is to use ML to enhance experimental instruments and molecular simulations in biomedical and material sciences, while exploring cross-disciplinary applications such as disease diagnosis, biomarker sensing, and cancer research. My goal is to unlock MLâ€™s transformative potential to drive impactful scientific advancements across diverse fields, ultimately benefiting society by enhancing people's health and wellness.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am a co-founder of [iDeal technology LLC](https://www.idealtechnology.org/home/) and developed a mobile app on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uni.UNI6849AE0) and [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ideal%E7%88%B1%E5%85%9C/id1511598159) helping community rentaling and trading.  These experiences have honed my skills in entrepreneurship and leadership, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical solutions.
