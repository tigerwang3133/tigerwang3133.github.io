I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Rice University](https://www.rice.edu/), with a background as a Schreyer Honors Scholar majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics from [The Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/). I am currently a member of [SCOPE lab](https://scopelab.rice.edu/), advised by [Prof. Shengxi Huang](https://profiles.rice.edu/faculty/shengxi-huang) and work closely with [Prof. Yuxuan 'Cosmi' Lin](https://engineering.tamu.edu/materials/profiles/lin-yuxuan-cosmi.html). My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), computational science, and experimental technology, focusing on developing machine learning (ML) methodologies to advance biomedical sciences, materials research, and molecular sensing. 

My research has advanced AI-powered spectroscopy for disease diagnosis, biomarker discovery, virus identification, cancer research, and next-generation material characterization. Building on these contributions, I aim to embed AI into the core of scientific discovery by developing interpretable, data-driven frameworks that enable early diagnostics, guide materials design, and drive automated sensing platforms. In parallel, I am extending these approaches to cross-disciplinary domains such as food safety, environmental monitoring, and public health, thereby broadening their real-world impact. The overarching goal of my research is to harness machine learning’s transformative potential to accelerate discovery and foster breakthroughs that enhance human health and global well-being.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am a co-founder of [iDeal technology LLC](https://www.idealtechnology.org/home/) and developed a mobile app on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uni.UNI6849AE0) and [IOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ideal%E7%88%B1%E5%85%9C/id1511598159) helping community rentals and trading.  These experiences have honed my skills in entrepreneurship and leadership, allowing me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical solutions.
